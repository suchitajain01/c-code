/*properties of friend functions 
1)  not in the scope of class
2) since it is not in the scope of class it cannot be called  from the object of the class 
   that is class.c1.sumComplec() == invalid

3) Can be invoked without the healp of any object
4) usually contains the objects as arguments 
5) can be delared inside private and public section of the class 
6) it cannot access the members directly by theior names and need object_name.member_name to access any member
